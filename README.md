 Always be a function of X^2 as it's value leads to positive one. Whatever the values X may have (whether +ve or -ve) the function gonna increase everywhere.
           Difficulties and ease , sadness and  happiness, gain and loss, excitement and depression  are the parts of our life. There is no imagination of the person who didn't have any problem in his life . Each and everyone is gonna tested with some situation by the God. So, keep calm, be hopefull,stand with the courage that you have, and prove yourself as a good servant to the almighty Allah.
           If you have written some codes and it's not compile or run, wait for a moment,leave some time ,think before you compiled it again.
           If you success say thanks to God,say ALHAMDULILLAH.
